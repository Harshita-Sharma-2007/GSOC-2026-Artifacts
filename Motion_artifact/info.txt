Artifact Name: Motion Artifact
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Motion

Short Description:
Motion artifact occurs when the patient moves during the ASL scan,
causing misalignment between images and unreliable perfusion values.

How It Appears in Image:
Motion artifact appears as blurring, ghosting, or misaligned brain
structures across ASL images, especially between control and label images.

Primary Cause:
Patient movement during scan acquisition, especially between label
and control images.

Clinical Impact:
Motion artifact can lead to incorrect cerebral blood flow values,
reducing the reliability of ASL results.

Severity Level:
Moderate to Severe

Common Fix:
Instruct patient to stay still, use motion correction during preprocessing,
and reject scans with excessive motion.
