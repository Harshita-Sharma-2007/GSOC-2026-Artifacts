Artifact Name: Vascular Artifact
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Physiological

Short Description:
Intravascular signal remains visible due to incomplete suppression of labeled blood.

How It Appears in Image:
Bright linear or tubular structures corresponding to arteries.

Primary Cause:
Short post-labeling delay or incomplete vascular crushing.

Clinical Impact:
Overestimation of perfusion in arterial regions.

Severity Level:
Moderate

Common Fix:
Increase post-labeling delay and apply vascular crushing gradients.
