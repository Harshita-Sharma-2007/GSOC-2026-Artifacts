Artifact Name: Susceptibility Artifact
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Magnetic Field

Short Description:
Signal distortion caused by magnetic field inhomogeneity near air-tissue interfaces.

How It Appears in Image:
Geometric distortion or signal dropout near sinuses and ear regions.

Primary Cause:
Magnetic susceptibility differences between tissues and air.

Clinical Impact:
Localized loss of perfusion information.

Severity Level:
Moderate

Common Fix:
Use distortion correction techniques and optimized acquisition sequences.
