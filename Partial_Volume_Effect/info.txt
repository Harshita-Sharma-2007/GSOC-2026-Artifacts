Artifact Name: Partial Volume Effect
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Imaging Limitation

Short Description:
Signal mixing occurs when a voxel contains multiple tissue types.

How It Appears in Image:
Blurring between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid regions.

Primary Cause:
Limited spatial resolution.

Clinical Impact:
Inaccurate perfusion quantification, especially in cortical regions.

Severity Level:
Moderate

Common Fix:
Use higher spatial resolution and apply partial volume correction algorithms.
