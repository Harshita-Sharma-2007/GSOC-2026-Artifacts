Artifact Name: Background Suppression Failure
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Technical

Short Description:
Background suppression failure occurs when static tissue signals are not properly suppressed during ASL acquisition.

How It Appears in Image:
Images show unusually bright static tissue background, reducing contrast between perfusion signal and surrounding tissue.

Primary Cause:
Incorrect timing of inversion pulses or improper sequence parameter setup.

Clinical Impact:
Reduced sensitivity to perfusion changes and inaccurate cerebral blood flow estimation.

Severity Level:
Moderate

Common Fix:
Optimize inversion timing parameters and verify sequence configuration before acquisition.
