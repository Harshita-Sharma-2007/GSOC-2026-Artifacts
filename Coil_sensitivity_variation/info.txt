Artifact Name: Coil Sensitivity Variation
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Hardware

Short Description:
Signal intensity variation caused by uneven sensitivity of multi-channel receiver coils.

How It Appears in Image:
Gradual intensity shading across the image, often brighter near the coil and darker farther away.

Primary Cause:
Non-uniform radiofrequency coil sensitivity profile.

Clinical Impact:
Misinterpretation of perfusion asymmetry and biased quantitative measurements.

Severity Level:
Moderate

Common Fix:
Apply coil sensitivity correction or intensity normalization during preprocessing.
