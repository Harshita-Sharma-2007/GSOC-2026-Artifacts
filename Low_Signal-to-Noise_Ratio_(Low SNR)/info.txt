Artifact Name: Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Modality: ASL MRI
Category: Signal Quality

Short Description:
Low SNR occurs when perfusion signal is weak relative to background noise.

How It Appears in Image:
Grainy appearance with poor contrast and unstable perfusion maps.

Primary Cause:
Low labeling efficiency, short acquisition time, or patient motion.

Clinical Impact:
Reduced diagnostic reliability and increased measurement variability.

Severity Level:
Moderate to Severe

Common Fix:
Increase number of averages, optimize labeling parameters, and reduce motion.
